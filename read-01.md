# What is a Component?
* A component is a modular, portable, replaceable 
* 
* and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

* A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities.

*  It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.

* A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only. That is,

* a software component can be deployed independently and is subject to composition by third parties.

What are the charactistics of a component?

1-Reusability

2-Replaceable

3-Not context specific

4-Extensible

5-Encapsulated

6-Independent

What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

1-Ease of deployment.

2-Modification of technical complexity.

3-Reduced cost.

4-System maintenance and evolution.


5-Reusable.

6-Ease of development.

# What is Props?

### “Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

**But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)**

**Furthermore, props data is read-only, which means that data coming from the parent should not be changed by child components.**

# What is a ‘Controlled Component’? 

A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state

# Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

# How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

we use callback function onclick for exmaple onclick that invokes the fucntion witch change the staste based on the changes.

# Why would we use a ternary operator?
to right a conditional statment in one line


# Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

``` if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  } 
  
  ```


### answer

``` 
x===y?  console.log(true) :console.log(false);

```
